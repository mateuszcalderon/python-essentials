# I am an Block Comment and I am NOT executed!

# Defining the variables:
programming_language = "Python"
year = 1991

# Printing the variables:
print(programming_language + " was created in " + str(year) + ".")  # I am an Inline Comment and I am NOT executed!

# Using a 'if' loop to show the importance of Indentation:
if 10 > 5:
    print("10 is greater than 5.")  # Right use of Indentation.

"""
if 10 > 5:
print("10 is greater than 5.")  # Wrong use of Indentation. This will cause an IndentationError."
